Chat with Dataframe - Streamlit Chatbot using Langchian Agent and Ollama | Generative AI | LLM
The chatbot processes user-uploaded data by displaying a preview of the data frame, which allows users to ask questions.
An agent invokes a language model that generates relevant Python code, producing answers based on the data provided.
The chatbot allows users to upload CSV or Excel files, which it reads and converts into a Pandas DataFrame, enabling interactive querying of the data.
Using session state in Streamlit applications allows developers to maintain user interactions across different components of the app, preserving variables and data throughout the user session, which is essential for delivering a coherent user experience.
The file upload feature enables users to provide their datasets for analysis, allowing the chatbot to generate insights and answer questions based on user-provided data. This interaction fosters a more engaging and personalized experience.
Managing chat history allows the application to maintain context during conversations, enabling users to ask follow-up questions and providing continuity in interactions.
The temperature setting determines the randomness of the language model's responses. A lower temperature value leads to more consistent and repetitive answers, while a higher value introduces greater variability and creativity in the responses.
Using a DataFrame agent allows the chatbot to handle structured data efficiently and respond to user queries by generating and executing relevant Python code dynamically, thus providing accurate responses based on the data at hand.
Managing chat history is crucial for maintaining continuity in conversations, allowing users to review previous interactions and keeping track of inquiries and responses, which aids in troubleshooting and improving user experience.
Chatbot systems maintain context by storing chat histories, which are then referenced during subsequent interactions to ensure the language model can provide relevant and coherent responses.
Language models analyze user queries and generate corresponding actions, such as Python code execution, based on the inputs provided by users and the context obtained from previous interactions.
